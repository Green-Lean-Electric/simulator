# Simulator Project

The Simulator project is in charge of all the calculations for the Green Lean Electrics Project (```https://github.com/Green-Lean-Electric```), such as the electricity production, consumption, price or the wind speed. Itâ€™s an application which infinitely runs and computes each second the new values for the power plants, the prosumers and the market.

## Online Usage

You can use our project on our serveur with the following links :

Manager ```http://145.239.75.80:8082/```

Prosumer ```http://145.239.75.80:8081/``` 
 
## Installation

Download and install Node.js version 12 or higher. Lower versions may not work due to advanced JavaScript features. 

Download and install on localhost MongoDB version 4 or higher. Default port should be 27017.

Clone all projects repositories (Simulator, Prosumer, Manager & Utils)

Inside each project run 

```bash
npm install
```
This should install Node.js dependencies we have used throughout our application.


## Local Usage

You can now start the three main projects. From the root folder, launch the following commands:


```bash
node simulator/src/server.js
node manager/src/server.js
node prosumer/src/server.js
```

The servers should now be up and running and you should be able to access to your web interfaces at "localhost:8081" (prosumer interface) and "localhost:8082" (manager interface).

Please note that if you test our application on a Windows computer, the registration mails can't be send. We recommend you to test it on a Unix computer. 

However, if you only have a Windows computer, you need a few more steps to activate an account (manager & prosumer) after its registration:

- open your localhost MongoDB "greenleanelectrics" database.
- look for the prosumer (collection "prosumer") or the manager (collection "manager") you want to activate.
- delete the "registrationToken" field.
